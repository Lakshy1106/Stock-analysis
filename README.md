# Stock-market-analysis
This repository has all my codes I have created for stock market analysis.
The repository is for public use and database which will be analysed must be downloaded by the user.
(A good website for downloading databases is yahoo finance.)

How to use these codes.
1) Download all the codes to a folder in your computer.
2) To add your database download the data files in csv format from any website you choose. (yahoo finance has been tested and must be preferred)
3) Create a Database folder inside the folder you made for the code files and save all your csv files in that folder.
4) When running the code put the correct file name and code must analyse the data.
